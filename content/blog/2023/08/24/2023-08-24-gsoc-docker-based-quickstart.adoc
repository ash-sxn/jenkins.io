== About the Project

The goal of my project was to address the problems and complexities users often face when setting up Jenkins with Docker. The current process involves multiple intimidating steps with security risks. My goal was to solve this problem with Docker Compose by creating a Docker Compose file and regularly testing it. Part of the project also involved adding easy-to-understand documentation and tutorials, as well as a one-click Gitpod setup.

What will changed in Jenkins after this project:

* Previously, users had to use six scary commands to set up Jenkins with Docker. which looks like this

After this project, users will only need two commands: `git clone URL` and `docker-compose up -d`.
* The same applies to tutorials that use the same Docker setup as above; users will only need to use `docker-compose up -d <keyword>` after cloning the repo.
* Users can now use a one-click setup with Gitpod to experience Jenkins.
* These Docker Compose files are being tested regularly with GitHub Actions right now, we will move it to Jenkins later.


== Phase 1

In Phase 1, we tried to achieve this outcome with scripts. We created `jenkins_init.sh` and `jenkins_teardown.sh` scripts for running and stopping the containers, as well as other scripts for SSH key generation and cloning/forking repos.

During Phase 1, I learned about:

* Git and GitHub best practices
* Resolving merge conflicts
* The Jenkins file system
* Docker Compose files
* Shell scripts
* Dockerfiles
* How SSH keys work
* How Gitpod works
* How to write technical documentation

== Phase 2

During Phase 2, the focus shifted to integrating Windows as well since the shell scripts from Phase 1 wouldn't work without WSL on Windows. That's when we discovered profiles in Docker Compose, which turned out to be perfect for this; the tutorials worked just like our previous scripts with keywords.

Another part of the project was automated testing, for which I learned about GitHub Actions (which I didn't know before). It's used for testing the working of Docker Compose files, uploading Docker images to Docker Hub, updating plugins, and some other things.

In Phase 2, I learned about:

* Docker Compose files
* GitHub Actions
* The Jenkins Remote Access API

== Next Steps

The upcoming steps for the project include:

- Fully integrating it into jenkins.io.
- Shifting from using GitHub Actions to jenkins.ci.
- Adding the repo to Hacktoberfest with good first issues for beginner contributors.
- Another stretch goal is to add more tutorials to the project.

== Conclusion

In conclusion, participating in GSoC 2023 was an incredible experience that allowed me to learn new skills and contribute to an open-source project. I am grateful for the opportunity and would like to thank my mentors and the Jenkins community for their support and guidance. I look forward to continuing to contribute.
