Hello, Jenkins community! I am really excited to be a GSoC 2023 contributor for Docker-based Jenkins quickstart examples project. In this blog post, I will take you through the details of the project in the following: 

== Project Description

The Docker based jenkins quickstart examples project aims to simplify Jenkins integration with Docker by providing user-friendly Docker Compose files and updating the documentation. Regular testing on ci.jenkins.io ensures reliability. By leveraging Docker Compose, the setup process becomes more straightforward for beginners and allows customization for experienced users. Automated testing in a Jenkins pipeline validates the Docker Compose files functionality, while the Pipeline Steps doc generator maintains up-to-date documentation. Gitpod facilitates quickstart with a .gitpod.yml file running docker-compose commands, enabling easy preview of Jenkins instances. These efforts will enhance the user experience and make Jenkins-Docker integration more seamless and efficient. 
The main motivation for this project is that the current quickstart process with Jenkins using the existing Docker examples is too complex. The available documentation is also hard to understand with lots of docker commands to follow, making it challenging for new users to get started.

=== Introduction
I am an IT undergraduate from India, I just gave my second year exams so I’ll be a third year student after this summer. I have a keen interest in DevOps and Cybersecurity. I heard of open source in my freshman year and loved the Idea of free and open software for all. 

== Why Jenkins?

I got to know of Jenkins while I was learning DevOps and after learning about Open Source I was eager to start contributing and be a part of a community. And Jenkins was built on Java which was the first language that I have learned. So I started to look into the Jenkins community. In the beginning, I couldn’t understand much about the issues and that’s where Hacktoberfest came into the picture. It was the push that I needed to submit my first PR, and I also got a t-shirt from the participation too. During Hacktoberfest the playlist about modernizing jenkins plugins by Mark Waite and Darin Pope was really helpful. After that I saw a post about Jenkins participating in GSoC 2023. That's when I started to look into GSoC, and during preparation of the GSoC proposal the community helped me a lot and nudged me in the right direction to learn new things and reviewed my proposal. 

=== Engaging with the community
I plan to give my all this summer to complete GSoC successfully and learn a lot of new things from the community,  especially the communication part as I am not that good at it. I’ll give my all. 
And I hope that my contribution this summer can have a positive impact on the community. 
How I’d plan to be a part of community after GSoC:

* I’d like to participate in events like Hacktoberfest to help others become part of the community. 
* I’d like to work on my original goal of improving my Java skills through contributions to the Jenkins core. 
* I’d like to adopt a plugin. 
* I’d like to participate in GSoC as a mentor in the future from Jenkins. 

== Conclusion
I want to thank the community for selecting me for GSoC 2023 and helping me to prepare for it. And special thanks to my mentors for giving their precious time and mentoring me this summer. I hope my contributions will be a useful addition to Jenkins.  
I’m looking forward to working with you all this summer!
